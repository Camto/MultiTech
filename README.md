Some homework I did for Spanish / History class. They let me make _web pages_ for homework! **Yeah!**
All the `HTML` / `CSS` / `JavaScript` is custom, but how the menu bar works was taken from [w3schools.com's](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp "How To Create a Dropdown Menu With CSS and JavaScript") tutorial of `HTML` / `CSS` menus.
